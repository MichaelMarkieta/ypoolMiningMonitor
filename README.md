ypool Mining Monitor
====================

Source code for the Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.michaelmarkieta

The ypool mining pool has over 145,000 workers and approximately 2000 users online throughout the day. This app provides the perfect package of personal, global and miner hardware statistics for the "on-the-go" user. Designed using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, this cross-platform and mobile friendly app was designed to be beautiful, as much as it is functional.

You're welcome to make comments on Google Play, but I strongly recommend adding issues to the github repo. Everyone is welcome to inspect the source code and contribute to the development of the app.

Donations are very much appreciated in the form of:
